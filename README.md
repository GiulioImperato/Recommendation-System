## 🎯 Objective

The service is designed to:  
* Manage a catalogue of movies;  
* Track and manage user interactions;  
* Recommend movies.

### Interaction/Event Types

**Rating**: Integer rating from 1 (dislike) to 5 (like)

**View**: A view percentage from 0% to 100%  
⤷ Converted into **implicit ratings** as:
* 60–80% → Rating 4  
* 81%-100% → Rating 5  

**Note**: Explicit ratings override implicit ones.

## 🛠️ Built With

* Java 21  
* Spring Boot 3.4.5  
* JPA  
* H2 (testing) / PostgreSQL (production-ready)  
* JUnit  
* Maven  
* Docker  

## 🛠️ Functional Requirements

### 1. Retrieve a list of all movies

Retrieve a list of all movies with the possibility to specify optional query parameters:  
* **genre**: filter movies by genre;
* **minRating**: filter movies with an average rating above a certain value;
* **maxRating**: filter movies with an average rating below a certain value.

### 2. Retrieve a user's interaction history

Retrieve a user's interaction history. The API has to provide an optional query parameter to retrieve ratings only, views only or both.

### 3. Add an event for a movie by the user

Ingest a new event (rating or view) for a movie by updating the user's interaction history in the database and adjusting recommendation results accordingly.

### 4. Recommend movies for a user

Retrieve a list of recommended movies similar to those that the user has rated highly (e.g. 4 and 5) and hasn't rated yet. For sake of simplicity, similarity between movies has to be computed on “Genre” metadata only. Optionally, prioritize movies with the higher number of events.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Add or update interactions via `PUT /interactions`  
✅ Get personalized movie recommendations via `GET /recommendations/{userId}`  
✅ Uses genre affinity & interaction count sorting strategies  
✅ Built-in Swagger documentation  
✅ Prepopulated database using CSV files  
✅ Dockerized setup with PostgreSQL and PgAdmin

## 📖 API Specification

This project provides a fully documented, self-describing RESTful API, allowing developers and stakeholders to explore and understand the system's capabilities **without digging into the source code**.

### 🔍 Swagger UI

A live, interactive **Swagger UI** included out of the box. It offers:

- 🧭 **Clear REST endpoint documentation**;
- 🧪 **Detailed request/response examples**;
- ✅ **Try-it-out functionality** for quick manual testing

Once the app is running, access the UI at:  
👉 [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

#### 🛠️ Use Cases

Swagger UI is ideal for:
- Quickly testing new API features during development
- Validating request payloads without external tools
- Demonstrating functionality to reviewers or stakeholders

> If you're using Docker, Swagger will be available as soon as the `app` service is up.

### 🔧 APIs

```
GET     /api/v1/movies                          List all movies with optional filters
GET     /api/v1/interactions/{userId}/history   Retrieve a user's interaction history
PUT     /api/v1/interactions/addevent           Add an event (rating or view) for a movie by the user
GET     /api/v1/recommendations/{userId}        Get movie recommendations for a specific user
GET     /api/v1/users                           Retrieve all users in the system
```

Each endpoint is fully documented in Swagger, including:
- Query parameters;
- Request bodies;
- Example payloads;
- Response formats and HTTP status codes.

> 🔄 Swagger is auto-generated from the code using SpringDoc.


## 📥 Provided Data Files

The application uses CSV files to **prepopulate the database** on startup:

- `users.csv` contains user information. 
- `movies.csv` contains movie information.
- `ratings.csv` contains user ratings for movies. 

> ✅ No manual data entry required.  
> 📁 Files located in `src/main/resources/data/csv`

These files are loaded automatically by the `DataLoader` class at application startup to ensure immediate usability.

## 🐳 Docker, Containerization & Deployment

This project comes with full Docker support, allowing you to spin up the entire environment - including the application, a PostgreSQL database, and a visual database inspector—without manual setup.

The system includes a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for easy deployment.

### 🧩 docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: recommendation_db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: recommendation
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "postgres"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  app:
    build: .
    container_name: recommendation_app
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: prod
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/recommendation
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: postgres
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: postgres

  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    container_name: pgadmin
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@demo.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: admin
    ports:
      - "5050:80"
    depends_on:
      - db
```

The docker-compose.yml orchestrates three key services:

DB – PostgreSQL Database
* Uses postgres:15
* Loads schema from init.sql;
* Exposes port 5432;
* Includes a health check to ensure it's ready before the app starts

Spring Boot App - Recommendation Service
* Built from the Dockerfile;
* Connects to the internal PostgreSQL instance;
* Runs under the prod Spring profile;
* Exposes APIs on port 8080.

PgAdmin – Visual Database Interface
* Exposes a web interface on port 5050 to inspect the database visually.

### 🐳 Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/RecommendationSystem-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```
### 🔄 Database Initialization with `init.sql`

The `init.sql` file is automatically mounted into the PostgreSQL container via the volume mapping defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
```

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 🛠 Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have Docker (v20+ recommended) installed on your machine.

### Run

Build the app (if not already built):

```
./mvnw clean package
```

Start the stack:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

Once services are up:
* Access Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html).
* Access PgAdmin.

#### 🔌 Connecting to PgAdmin

Go to [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050).

Login: admin@demo.com / admin.

Create a new server with:
* Host: db;
* Port: 5432;
* Username: postgres;
* Password: postgres.

Done! You can now explore the PostgreSQL schema. This enables full visual access to all tables and relationships in the system.

## 📊 API Testing

You can interact with the REST API via:  

* Swagger UI;  
* Postman (import collection from `/postman/Recommendation System.postman_collection.json`);
* cURL;



## 🧪 Testing Strategy & Coverage

A bottom-up testing strategy was adopted:  

✅ Starting from the most critical and atomic components;

✅ Covering business logic and recommendation strategies; 

✅ Verified API endpoints via E2E testing. 

I deliberately excluded unit tests for DTOs, mappers, and entities, as they are indirectly tested through integration and strategy tests.  Dedicated unit tests were deemed unnecessary.

### Test Database
* Uses embedded H2 in-memory database;
* Schema built via SQL: test/schema.sql;
* Data loaded via SQL: test/import.sql.

This approach guarantees:
* Fast and repeatable tests;
* Zero side-effects on the actual PostgreSQL database;
* Easy schema and data setup via SQL.

### ✅ Code Coverage

To validate the effectiveness of the tests, code coverage was measured using [EclEmma (JaCoCo)](https://www.eclemma.org/). The following snapshot shows the current test coverage across packages:

<img src="Coverage.png" alt="Coverage" width="979" height="607">

A high coverage rate was achieved, confirming the effectiveness of the bottom-up test approach.

The current focus has been on covering the most significant logic (strategies, mappers, utils, and repository methods). Additional test cases will extend coverage further in future iterations.

### 🧪 Testing Highlights

* <b>RatingUtilsTest.java</b>: confirms correct conversion from view percentages to implicit ratings.
* <b>MovieRepositoryTest.java</b>: tests native SQL query to retrieve movie recommendations.
* <b>GenreAffinityFilterTest.java</b>: validates the Genre Affinity Filter strategy for recommending movies based on users’ high-rated genres.
* <b>InteractionCountSorterTest.java</b>: validates the sort strategy to ensure correct ordering by interaction count.


## 🧩 DB Schema: Design Choices

The database schema was deliberately kept simple yet expressive, closely mirroring the domain model. This allows for a natural mapping between Java entities and relational tables, minimizing boilerplate and avoiding overengineering.

### ✨ Key Design Highlights

Each concept in the system - User, Movie, Interaction, Genre - is represented as a distinct table. This ensures data consistency and avoids redundancy.

* **Users**: stores application users, identified by a unique ID and a username.
* **Movies**: stores movies, each with a unique ID and title.
* **Interactions**: core junction table capturing both ratings and view percentages between users and movies. Supports both explicit and implicit feedback.
* **movie_genres**: associates movies to multiple genres using a simple key-value structure (movie_id, genre). This design avoids the need for a fixed genre enum and allows flexibility.

### 🔗 Relationships
One-to-Many:
* One user can have many interactions.
* One movie can be associated with many interactions.
* One movie can have multiple genres via movie_genres.

Composite Logic in Interactions:
* The interactions table combines rating, view_percentage, and explicit flags in a unified format. This approach avoids splitting interactions into multiple tables or types.
* Ratings are either user-provided (explicit=true) or inferred from viewing behaviour (explicit=false).

### ⚡ Designed for Scalability

* The movie_genres table enables multi-genre assignment without altering the schema, making it easy to add new genres dynamically.

* Interaction data is modeled in a way that can grow significantly with user behavior tracking - without affecting performance or introducing denormalized structures.

### 🧠 Conclusion

✅ Clean, flexible, and expressive.

✅ Domain-aligned with no impedance mismatch.

✅ Easily extendable for future metadata like release year, actors, or content type.

This design was chosen to strike a balance between simplicity, maintainability, and scalability, perfectly serving the functional and performance needs of the recommendation system.

## ⚙️ RESTful API Considerations

### Use of HTTP PUT for Insert or Update

In RESTful architecture, `PUT` is the preferred method for **idempotent** operation - where multiple identical requests result in the same outcome. This design principle has been carefully adopted in this project for managing **user interactions** with movies.

#### Where it's applied:

- **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v1/interactions/addevent`

This endpoint is used to create or update an interaction. Specifically:

- If an interaction (i.e., a user-movie pair) already exists, it is **updated** with the new rating or view percentage.
- If it does **not exist**, a new interaction is **inserted**.

This insert/update behaviour ensures:
- Clients don't need to check for the existence of an interaction before sending data.
- Reduces complexity on the client side.
- Maintains RESTful principles by allowing safe retries without side effects.

#### Why this choice?

- ✅ **Idempotency**: guarantees consistency regardless of repeated requests.
- ✅ **Simplicity**: reduces need for multiple endpoints (`POST` + `PATCH`) and conditional logic.
- ✅ **Clarity**: aligns with expected behavior in scenarios where user interaction evolves over time (e.g., rating updated after a second viewing).


## ⚡ Native Query Performance

A custom native query is used in MovieRepository to fetch recommendations efficiently.
This query selects movies not yet rated by the user, with an average rating >= 4,
and matches the user’s preferred genres. It also counts the total number of interactions to support prioritization.

```bash
@Query(value = """
			SELECT m.id, m.title, COUNT(*) AS interactions_count
			FROM movies m
			JOIN interactions i
			ON i.movie_id = m.id
			WHERE m.id NOT IN (
				SELECT movie_id
				FROM interactions
				WHERE user_id = :userId
				AND rating IS NOT NULL
			)
			AND (
				SELECT AVG(rating)
				FROM interactions
				WHERE movie_id = m.id
				AND rating IS NOT NULL
			) >= 4
			AND m.id in (
				select g.movie_id
				from movie_genres g
				where g.genre IN (:preferredGenres)
				GROUP by g.movie_id
			)
			GROUP BY m.id, m.title
			""", nativeQuery = true)
```

Why Native Query?

✅ Better performance with large datasets.

✅ Avoids and reduce JVM memory overuse.

✅ Avoids expensive entity graph loading.
